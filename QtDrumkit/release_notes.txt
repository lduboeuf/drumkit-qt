Qt Drumkit
==============

Qt Drumkit is a virtual drumkit which lets you play percussion sounds
by tapping the screen.   

The application contains two views for playing, a simple view with 2D
pads and a 3D drumkit view. You can record your beats and play them
back afterwards. It's also possible to play on top of your last
recording.  

The user interface is implemented with QML. The sound engine and
playback logic is C++, which is accessed from QML. For audio playback
the application uses a combination of  Qt GameEnabler,  DevSound
(native Symbian library) and  PulseAudio (native MeeGo library). 

This project is hosted in a Nokia Developer Project at:
